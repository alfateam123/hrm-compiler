# Cumulative Countdown
# For each thing in the INBOX,
# OUTBOX the sum of itself plus all numbers down to zero.
# for example, if INBOX is 3, OUTBOX should be 6,
# as 1+2+3 = 6

# start setup
alias 5 ZERO
alias 0 x
alias 1 acc

start:
emp = inbox
x = emp
acc = emp

cumulate:

	jmp start
else
	decr x
	emp += acc
	acc = emp
